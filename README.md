# bike_game
This is a simple bike game that I created by the advantage of a video tutorial of K3dev, a YouTube channel. You should use the up, right, down, and left buttons on your keyboard to play. Up button speeds up the bike while the down button decreases its speed. Left and Right buttons skew the bike relative to them. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to create this simple game.
